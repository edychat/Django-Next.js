// This file is required by Metro bundler as the default entry-point for the
// mobile npm workspace package.  The workspace is a monorepo
// container – not a library to be imported directly – but Metro follows
// package.json symlinks and tries to resolve "main" (defaulting to ./index)
// for every package it encounters in the workspace.  Without this file Metro
// throws: "Unable to resolve module ./index from app/mobile/."
